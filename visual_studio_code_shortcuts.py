# when you want to comment out a bunch of code quickly first highlight the code then press "ctrl" + "/"
# if you want to make a block comment in python use tripple double quotation marks
"""Here is an example of block comments
You will not be limited to only one line of text for your comment when using block comments.
If you only need one line of comment use the octothorpe or hashtag (#).
Best practice for a block comment is to have the trailing tripple double quotation marks on their own line once you have finished
the comment block.
